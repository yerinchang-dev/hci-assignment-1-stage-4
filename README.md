# Path@Penn Prototype

This is a static HTML/CSS prototype for a redesigned course registration interface, created for an HCI assignment. Itâ€™s a mockup meant to show layout and interaction ideas, not a fully working system.

## Attribution

- I used ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5) to help generate the base HTML/CSS code and refine styles.  
- The icons in the prototype (ðŸ“¶, ðŸ“¡, ðŸ”‹, ðŸ’¬, ðŸ“…, â€º) are Unicode characters that render in most browsers.  
- The Penn shield image (`upennshield.png`) was added manually and is not generated.

## Notes

- Buttons and forms donâ€™t connect to a backend. This is just a visual prototype.  
- You can test the layout on mobile by resizing the browser window or using developer tools.
